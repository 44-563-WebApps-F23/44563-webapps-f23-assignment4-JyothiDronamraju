   <h3>'An Enemy of the People Act 2' by Henrik Ibsen</h3>
   <h3>Mrs. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>(going to the door) Father!—is it you?</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Ah, Mr. Kiil—good morning, good morning!</p>
   <h3>Mrs. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>But come along in.</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>If it is true, I will; if not, I am off.</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>If what is true?</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>This tale about the water supply, is it true?</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Certainly it is true, but how did you come to hear it?</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>(coming in) Petra ran in on her way to the school—</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Did she?</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>Yes; and she declares that—I thought she was only making a fool of me—but it isn't like Petra to do that.</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Of course not. How could you imagine such a thing!</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
