   <h3>'An Enemy of the People Act 2' by Henrik Ibsen</h3>
   <h3>Mrs. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>(going to the door) Father!—is it you?</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Ah, Mr. Kiil—good morning, good morning!</p>
   <h3>Mrs. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>But come along in.</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>If it is true, I will; if not, I am off.</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>If what is true?</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>This tale about the water supply, is it true?</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Certainly it is true, but how did you come to hear it?</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>(coming in) Petra ran in on her way to the school—</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Did she?</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>Yes; and she declares that—I thought she was only making a fool of me—but it isn't like Petra to do that.</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Of course not. How could you imagine such a thing!</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>Oh well, it is better never to trust anybody; you may find you have been made a fool of before you know where you are. But it is really true, all the same?</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>You can depend upon it that it is true. Won't you sit down? (Settles him on the couch.) Isn't it a real bit of luck for the town—</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Yes, that I made the discovery in good time.</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>(as before) Yes, yes. Yes!—But I should never have thought you the sort of man to pull your own brother's leg like this!</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Pull his leg!</p>
   <h3>Mrs. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Really, father dear—</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>(resting his hands and his chin on the handle of his stick and winking slyly at the DOCTOR) Let me see, what was the story? Some kind of beast that had got into the water-pipes, wasn't it?</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Infusoria—yes.</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>And a lot of these beasts had got in, according to Petra—a tremendous lot.</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Certainly; hundreds of thousands of them, probably.</p>
   <h3>Morten Kiil.</h3>
   <p>But no one can see them—isn't that so?</p>
   <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
   <p>Yes; you can't see them,</p>
