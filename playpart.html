   <h3>'An Enemy of the People Act 2' by Henrik Ibsen</h3>
   <div class="speech dr-stockmann"><h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3><p> Oh, he really will be pleased enough, you know. But, at the same time, Peter is so confoundedly afraid of anyone's doing any service to the town except himself.</p></div>


   <div class="speech mrs-stockmann"><h3>Mrs. Stockmann.</h3> <p>I will tell you what, Thomas—you should be good natured, and share the credit of this with him. Couldn't you make out that it was he who set you on the scent of this discovery?</p></div>
   
   <div class="speech dr-stockmann"><h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3><p> I am quite willing. If only I can get the thing setright. I—</p></div>
   
   
      <div class="direction"><p>(MORTEN KIIL puts his head in through the door leading from the hall,looks around in an enquiring manner, and chuckles.)</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech morten-kiil"><h3>Morten Kiil</h3><p> (slyly). Is it—is it true?</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech mrs-stockmann"><h3>Mrs. Stockmann</h3><div class="direction"><p> (going to the door). Father!—is it you?</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech dr-stockmann"><h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3><p> Ah, Mr. Kiil—good morning, good morning!</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech mrs-stockmann"><h3>Mrs. Stockmann.</h3><p> But come along in.</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech morten-kiil"><h3>Morten Kiil.</h3><p> If it is true, I will; if not, I am off.</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech dr-stockmann"><h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3><p> If what is true?</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech morten-kiil"><h3>Morten Kiil.</h3><p> This tale about the water supply, is it true?</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech dr-stockmann"><h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3><p> Certainly it is true, but how did you come to hear it?</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech morten-kiil"><h3>Morten Kiil</h3><div class="direction"><p> (coming in). Petra ran in on her way to the school—</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech dr-stockmann"><h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3><p>Did she?</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech morten-kiil"><h3>Morten Kiil.</h3><p> Yes; and she declares that—I thought she was only making a fool of me—but it isn't like Petra to do that.</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech dr-stockmann"><h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3><p> Of course not. How could you imagine such a thing!</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech morten-kiil"><h3>Morten Kiil.</h3> <p>Oh well, it is better never to trust anybody; you may find you have been made a fool of before you know where you are. But it is really true, all the same?</p></div>
   
   
   <div class="speech dr-stockmann"><h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3><p> You can depend upon it that it is true. Won't you sit down? (Settles him on the couch.) Isn't it a real bit of luck for the town—</p></div>
