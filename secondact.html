        <h3>Morten Kiil</h3>
        <p> (suppressing his laughter). A bit of luck for the town?</p>

        <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
        <p>Yes, that I made the discovery in good time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speech morten-kiil">
        <h3>Morten Kiil</h3>
        <p> (as before). Yes, yes. Yes!—But I should never have thought you the sort of man to pull your own brother's leg like this!</p>

        <p> Pull his leg!</p>

        <p>(resting his hands and his chin on the handle of his stick and winking slyly at the DOCTOR). Let me see, what was the story? Some kind of beast that had got into the water-pipes, wasn't it?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="speech dr-stockmann">
        <h3>Dr. Stockmann.</h3>
        <p> Infusoria—yes.</p>
